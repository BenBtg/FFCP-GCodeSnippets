**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Environment**

* Your OS and the version of PrusaSlicer the issue is encountered with.
  Mind that bugs with alpha releases of PrusaSlicer should probably not be filed. Wait at least until the next beta release.
* The version of your GPX binary (try `gpx -?`)
* The version of your Perl runtime (try `perl --version`, obviously not needed if you are not using the Perl-based post-processing scripts).

**To Reproduce**

By far the most useful thing you can provide, is the PrusaSlicer project file (3MF) that demonstrates the problem: use “Save Project” in the File menu. If possible, also include both the final .gcode and .x3g files. You can package everything into one ZIP file.
* If specific steps are required to reproduce the behavior, list them here.
