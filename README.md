# G-code Snippets and Scripts for Using Slic3r with the Flashforge Creator Pro

This repository contains two things:

1. The G-code snippets to be used in combination with my Slic3r profiles as can be found on Thingiverse ([Thing:2367215](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2367215)). These are also published separately in [Thing:2367350](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2367350) for convenience. Look on those Thing pages for instructions.

2. The *make_fcp_x3g* script that can be configured as a post-processing script in Slic3r to run specific post-processing scripts and finally generate an X3G file by invoking [GPX](https://github.com/markwal/GPX). This is a Bash script and can also be used with the WSG Linux environment in recent versions of Windows. The .bat file and necessary changes to make this possible will be published soon but in the meantime you can take a look [here](https://gitlab.com/lscotte/3dprinting/tree/master/ffcp).
