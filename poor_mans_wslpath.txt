# This is a very crude approximation of the `wslpath` tool available in WSL
# environments starting from Windows 10 version 1803.
# If your WSL Linux environment already has a `wslpath` command, just ignore
# this file. Otherwise rename it to 'wslpath', make it executable, and place
# it in /usr/local/bin/.
# This will not work correctly for file names that contain unusual characters
# or if the mapping between Windows and Linux paths is not as expected.

shift  # ignore the first argument (should be -a, otherwise this script certainly won't act as expected).
